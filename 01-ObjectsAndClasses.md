# Object And Classes Q & A.


1. Describe the relationship between an object and its defining class.
    ```
        Ans: The relationship
        between classes and objects is analogous to that between an apple-pie recipe and apple pies:
        You can make as many apple pies as you want from a single recipe.
    ```

    ```java
        Ex: 
        public class ApplePie {
            String color;
            float weight;
            String[] flavors;
            int noOfSugarSpoons;

           public ApplePie(String color, float weight, String[] flavors, int noOfSpoons) {
               this.color = color;
               this.weight = weight;
               this.flavors = flavors;
               this.noOfSugarSpoons = noOfSpoons;
           }
        }

        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                ApplePie pie1 = new ApplePie("Red", 1.2f, new String[]{"Pineapple"}, 4);
            }
        }
    ```

1. How do you define a class ?

    ```
        Ans: We can define a class by using class keyword.

        Ex: class Car {
                String color;
                public Car() {
                    this.color = "Red";
                }

                public Car(String color) {
                    this.color = color;
                }

                public void setColor(String color) {
                    this.color = color;
                }
        }
    ```

1. How do you declare an objectâ€™s reference variable?

    ```
        Ans: By using it class name to define a reference variable.

        Ex:
            Circle c1;
            Square s1;
            Car forGt;
            Car suv;
    ```

1. How do you create an object?

    ```
        Ans: By using new keyword and invoking consturctor.

        
        Ex:
            Car car1 = new Car();
            Car car2 = new Car("Blue", true);
            Square s1 = new Square("Red", true);
            sysout(car2.getColor())
    ```

## Constructors

1. What are the differences between constructors and methods?

    ```
        Ans: i. Constructor will not have return type.
            ii. Constructor will have the same name of the class.
    ```

1. When will a class have a default constructor ?

    ```
        Ans: If user doesnot provide any constructor, java will provide the default constructor to the class.

        Ex: class User {
          
        }
    ```

1. Which operator is used to access a data field or invoke a method from an object?

    ```
        Ans: dot "." operator is used to invoke methods or access data fields.
    ```

1. What is an anonymous object?

    ```
        Ans: Creating a object without assiging it to a reference variable is called anonymous object.

        Ex: new Cricle().getColor()
    ```

1. What is NullPointerException ?

    ```
        Ans: NullPointerException is a common runtime error. It occurs when you invoke
            a method on a reference variable with a null value.
        
        Ex: Cricle c1 = null;
            c1.getColor();
    ```

1. Is an array an object or a primitive type value?

    ```
        Ans: An array is a object.
    ```

1. Can an array contain elements of an object type?

    ```
        Ans: Yes
    ```

1. Describe the default value for the elements of an array ?

    ```
        Ans: Default values are the values which are creating while initializing an array.
    ```

1. What is wrong with each of the following programs?

    ```java
        1. public class ShowErrors {
        2.    public static void main(String[] args) {
        3.       ShowErrors t = new ShowErrors(5);
        4.  }
        5. }

        Ans: There is a error in line number 3, because there is no constructor in ShowErrors class, which is taking int as a argument.
    ```

    ```java
        1. public class ShowErrors {
        2.    public static void main(String[] args) {
        3.       ShowErrors t = new ShowErrors();
        4.       t.x();
        5.  }
        6. }

        Ans: Line 4 is worng, as there is no method x defined in class ShowErrors.
    ```

    ```java
            1. public class ShowErrors {
            2. public void method1() {
            3. Circle c;
            4. System.out.println("What is radius "
            5. + c.getRadius());
            6. c = new Circle();
            7. }
            8. }

            Ans: Line 4 is worng, The local variable c may not have been initialized.
    ```

    ```java
        1. public class ShowErrors {
        2.      public staic void main(String[] args) {
        3.         C c = new C(5.0);
        4.         System.out.println(c.value);
        5.      }
        6.  }
        7.  class C {
        8.    int value = 2;
        9. }

        Ans: Line 3 is wrong, because there is no constructor in class C which takes dobule/float as argument.
    ```
